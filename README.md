# Standup Helper

At work our system for standup is to cycle alphabetically through people on Jira by clicking those little circles above the board. This tool will fetch the users using the Jira API, and will auto-click those circles for you. If a new member is added to Jira, it will ask you to confirm this user's position so that it knows how to deal with them.
